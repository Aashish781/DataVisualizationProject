About Dataset:<br /><br/>
The dataset I considered for the visualization is petroleum products consumption state-wise for different financial years starting from 2014-15, 2015-16 to 2020-21. The dataset contains a total of 40 instances corresponding to different states and nine columns corresponding to different financial years. The following three plots are plotted, and the observation of the same is given below:-

Bar plot: <br/><br/>
The bar plot below shows petroleum product consumption state-wise for 2020-21. The observations from the below plot are given below :-<br/>
* Gujarat consumes the most among all the states.<br/>
* Lakshwadeep consumption of petroleum products is the least among all the states.<br/>
* The top five consuming states are Gujarat, Maharastra, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh; all have consumption above 10000 TMT.<br/>

Scatter plot:<br/><br/>
The scatter plot shown below is of a few states (Bihar, Kerela, Delhi). It shows the trends in the consumption of petroleum products for different years. The following observations are made from the below plot:-<br/>
* Consumption in Kerala increased till 2019-20, and it took a dip in 2020-21.<br/>
* Consumption in Bihar increased yearly till 2020-21, without a dip between 2014-15 and 2020-21.<br/>
* Consumption in Delhi decreases every subsequent year compared to last year.<br/>

Box plot:<br/><br/>
The box plot below shows the variation in petroleum consumption year-wise. It shows the trends in the consumption of petroleum products state-wise for different years. The following observations are made from the below plot:-<br/>
* The box plot is narrowest in the year 2020-21, showing that the variation of petroleum consumption among all the states is less than in other years.<br/>
* The box plot was the widest in 2018-19, showing that the variation of petroleum consumption among all the states is more in other years.<br/>
* The median consumption for 2019-20 is the highest, and its value is 3119.50 TMT.<br/>
* The long upper whisker in the plot means consumption varies amongst the most positive quartile group for all the years.<br/>
